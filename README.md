# DataAnalyticsFinalProject
This is the code that was used in my Data Analytics Final Project on the Demographic Analysis of Higher Education

Final_Project.R holds the most recent code used for the project. By running it, the most up-to-date models can be seen. There is a random element, and since there is no seed results sould vary slightly from run to run. Packages used include RandomForest, e1071, and splitstackshape.

Final_OldCode.R holds older iterations of the code. Not completely commented, once an old piece of code was determined not to be used, it was moved over to this file. Older iterations of models can be found by moing the right code segments back into the other file.

The data used came from the following link from the OECD (Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development): https://stats.oecd.org/viewhtml.aspx?datasetcode=EDU_ENRL_FIELD&lang=en#
